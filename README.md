# Engineering Basics

In this workshop, you will setup a local (or virtual environment) consisting of several tools, programming languages, and libraries, to support software engineering work.  You will also practice workflows needed to be productive in software engineering.

The primary goal of this workshop is for you have to have installed and learned a set of relevant tools (and processes in your head) for software development.
